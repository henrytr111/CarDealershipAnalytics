# Project standards

- Metrics are defined in `docs/kpi_spec.md`.
- Data constraints and validation rules are defined in `docs/data_contract.md` and `docs/data_quality_plan.md`.
- Every model must have a model card in `docs/model_cards/`.
- Any output intended for sharing removes/anonymizes PII (Customer Name).
- Pipeline stages are reproducible (clear inputs/outputs).
- Dashboard and API have documented run instructions (eventually Docker-based).
